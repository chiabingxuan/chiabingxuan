ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am currently a Year 2 student at the National University of Singapore, majoring in Data Science and Analytics. A driven go-getter, I stay committed to my ardent pursuit for continuous improvement, doing my utmost to advance beyond preset goals and objectives. I am a consistent and reliable team-player who actively learns from his peers, whilst being capable of ensuring purposeful team coordination. At present, I am not only seeking opportunities to hone skills in Data Science, but am also eager to engage in fresh and meaningful experiences.
